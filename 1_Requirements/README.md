# INDUSTRIAL MONITORING SYSTEM
# INTRODUCTION
Industrial monitoring refers to the collection and analysis of essential industrial data and statistics related to processes, assets and devices used in the industrial premises to improve productivity and quality

# OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project is to design and develop a wireless communication link to monitor and control equipments that are far away from the user and also develop a high security system to keep a check on them. In an industry during certain hazards it will be very difficult to monitor the parameter through wires and analog devices such as transducers. Embedded system plays a vital role in this paper. It is a user-friendly application system. LCD plays a key role for transmitting the data. The main advantage of this concept is the real time direct measurement of the parameter. The stoppage and some accidents caused by increased co2 and methgane levels in air can be avoided.the co2 and Pressure levels are monitored directly which is simultaneously displayed in the LCD . the sensing is as usual done by sensors and then analysed by the controller, then the controller will take necessary steps regarding the received information. The parameters are transmitted via LCD modules to a control proom or office which is located faraway from the plant.

6) Fits our Gas Sensor Board (#27983) for convenient prototyping
# Application Ideas:
1) Safety Devices (harmful gas detection)
2) Environmental monitoring

# LCD 
A  liquid  crystal  display  (LCD)  is  a  thin,  flat  display  device  made  up  of  any  number  of  color  or  monochrome  pixels  arrayed  in  front  of  a  light  source  or  reflector. Each pixel consists  of  a  column  of  liquid  crystal  molecules  suspended  between  two  transparent  electrodes,  and  two  polarizing filters, the  axes of  polarity  of  which  are  perpendicular  to  each  other.  Without the liquid  crystals  between  them,  light  passing  through  one  would  be  blocked  by the other. The liquid crystal twists the polarization of light entering one filter to allow it to pass through the other.

# SWOT ANALYSIS
# APPLICATIONS
1) This type of system can be installed in any place where we need to maintain co2 and Pressure intensities 
2) This system also provided the automatic control of industrial parameters
3) This system mainly reduces the high manpower requirement in the industrial monitoring field by monitoring the overall industrial parameters through LCD
