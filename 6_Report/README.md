# ABSTRACT

1) The abstract of this project is to acquire the remote industrial parameters like CO2 and Pressure levels and send these real time values over LCD. 
2) The remote monitoring system using LCD undergoes three stages signal conditioning circuit, analog to digital converter and with LCD the message is send to remote office or anyother control unit. 
3) In this project the parameters are monitored with the use of sensors.
4) The sensed outputs are then sent to the controller and then the remote unit via wireless devices .
5) This process which is commonly seen in many industries the co2 and Pressure levels monitoring and control. 
6) This model can give a better idea to keep everything in control.
7) This project makes use of an onboard computer which is commonly termed as microcontroller. 
8) This onboard computer can efficiently communicate with the different sensors being used. 
9) The controller is provided with some internal memory to dump some set of assembly instructions into the controller.
10) The functioning of the controller is dependent on these assembly instructions. The controller is programmed using Embedded C language.


# INTRODUCTION
Industrial monitoring refers to the collection and analysis of essential industrial data and statistics related to processes, assets and devices used in the industrial premises to improve productivity and quality

# OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project is to design and develop a wireless communication link to monitor and control equipments that are far away from the user and also develop a high security system to keep a check on them. In an industry during certain hazards it will be very difficult to monitor the parameter through wires and analog devices such as transducers. Embedded system plays a vital role in this paper. It is a user-friendly application system. LCD plays a key role for transmitting the data. The main advantage of this concept is the real time direct measurement of the parameter. The stoppage and some accidents caused by increased co2 and methgane levels in air can be avoided.. Here, the co2 and Pressure levels are monitored directly which is simultaneously displayed in the LCD . the sensing is as usual done by sensors and then analysed by the controller, then the controller will take necessary steps regarding the received information. The parameters are transmitted via LCD modules to a control proom or office which is located faraway from the plant.

# PROPOSED SYSTEM
The design and implementation of industrial parameter monitoring & controlling system is the model with the ability to perform data acquisition on co2 nadPressure level detector sensors attached. These are then sent to the controller and then to the control board members or technicians who are faraway from the machines.

# WORKING PRINICIPAL
The general objective of this project is to design the monitoring and control system of industrial parameters using wireless communication. This project is used to reduce the high manpower requirement in industries by monitoring the overall parameters through a LCDe. And also controls the parameters without any manual operation. Basically, this project is designed with microcontrollers and various sensors The control process will automatically take place, only if the parameter exceeds the fixed value. For an instance, the co2 is sensed by the sensor,. The sensed data is then sent to the controller.  Likewise the Pressure level is also sensed.Here, the ATmega 8A microcontroller performs various operations like converting the received analog signals into digital values with the help of in-built ADC converter, storing the data with the help of FLASH memory, etc. to monitor the sensed values through a LCD display connected with the microcontroller.

# APPLICATIONS
1) This type of system can be installed in any place where we need to maintain co2 and Pressure intensities 
2) This system also provided the automatic control of industrial parameters
3) This system mainly reduces the high manpower requirement in the industrial monitoring field by monitoring the overall industrial parameters through LCD
