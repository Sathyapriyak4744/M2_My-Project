# PROJECT TITLE : INDUSTRIAL MONITORING SYSTEM 
# INDUSTRIAL MONITORING

Industrial monitoring refers to the collection and analysis of essential industrial data and statistics related to processes, assets and devices used in the industrial premises to improve productivity and quality

# ABSTRACT

1) The abstract of this project is to acquire the remote industrial parameters like CO2 and Pressure levels and send these real time values over LCD. 
2) The remote monitoring system using LCD undergoes three stages signal conditioning circuit, analog to digital converter and with LCD the message is send to remote office or anyother control unit. 
3) In this project the parameters are monitored with the use of sensors.
4) The sensed outputs are then sent to the controller and then the remote unit via wireless devices .
5) This process which is commonly seen in many industries the co2 and Pressure levels monitoring and control. 
6) This model can give a better idea to keep everything in control.
7) This project makes use of an onboard computer which is commonly termed as microcontroller. 
8) This onboard computer can efficiently communicate with the different sensors being used. 
9) The controller is provided with some internal memory to dump some set of assembly instructions into the controller.
10) The functioning of the controller is dependent on these assembly instructions. The controller is programmed using Embedded C language.
